# Connect4Game
## Mini-Max and Alpha-Beta Pruning
Optimization of Connect4 Game using Mini-Max Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm. This project evaluated the performance of the algorithm on 3 different metrics likely, Compilation Time Comparison, Space Allocation Comparison, and Accuracy Comparison. In conclusion, this project demonstrates that the alpha-beta pruning algorithm is a better implementation than the mini-max algorithm according to the time complexity scenario.
